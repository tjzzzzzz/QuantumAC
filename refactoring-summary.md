# QuantumAC Refactoring Summary

## Overview

We've successfully refactored several key checks in the QuantumAC anti-cheat plugin to use a component-based architecture. This approach improves code organization, maintainability, and reusability by breaking down complex checks into smaller, focused components.

## Refactored Checks

### KillAura Checks

1. **KillAuraD (Sprint Speed Check)**
   - Created `SprintSpeedComponent` to detect players who maintain sprint speed when attacking
   - Refactored `KillAuraD` to use this component

2. **KillAuraE (Dead Player Action Check)**
   - Created `DeadPlayerActionComponent` to detect players who send attack packets while dead
   - Refactored `KillAuraE` to use this component

3. **Base KillAura Class**
   - Created `KillAuraCheck` as a base class for all KillAura checks
   - Implemented common functionality for KillAura detection

### Fly Checks

1. **FlyB (Hover/Glide Detection)**
   - Created `HoverDetectionComponent` to detect players hovering in the air
   - Created `GlideDetectionComponent` to detect players gliding without permission
   - Created `GroundSpoofingComponent` to detect players spoofing their ground status
   - Refactored `FlyB` to use these components

2. **FlyC (Algorithmic Pattern Detection)**
   - Created `AlgorithmicPatternComponent` to detect mathematical patterns in movement
   - Created `PhaseDetectionComponent` to detect players moving through blocks
   - Refactored `FlyC` to use these components

3. **Base Fly Class**
   - Created `FlyCheck` as a base class for all Fly checks
   - Implemented common functionality for movement and environment detection

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Each component focuses on a specific detection mechanism
   - Clear separation of concerns between different types of checks

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Easier to update or fix individual detection mechanisms
   - Reduced code duplication across different checks

3. **Better Reusability**
   - Components can be shared across different checks
   - New checks can be created by combining existing components

4. **Simplified Testing**
   - Components can be tested in isolation
   - Easier to mock dependencies for unit testing

5. **Easier Debugging**
   - Issues can be isolated to specific components
   - Clearer error messages and violation details

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Refactoring**
   - Apply the component-based approach to remaining checks
   - Ensure consistent naming and structure across all components

2. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
   - Add examples of how to create new checks using components

3. **Testing**
   - Develop comprehensive tests for each component
   - Verify that refactored checks maintain the same detection capabilities

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the refactored code to identify any performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize components for maximum efficiency

## Conclusion

The refactoring to a component-based architecture has significantly improved the structure and maintainability of the QuantumAC plugin. This approach will make it easier to develop, test, and maintain the anti-cheat system going forward, while also providing a solid foundation for adding new detection mechanisms in the future.
